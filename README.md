# Android-Webview-upload

Webview is easy.

But Webview with download handler and file uploading comes with an issue.
after so many requests I made it simple version. Refer Installation section.


## Installation

Download or clone files. In android studio open this project. Change the URL to Your desired webpage/website

```bash
net::err_CLEARTEXT_NOT_PERMITTED
```
In case of this error.

Editing useCleartextTraffic attribute in manifest file
```bash
<application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
```


## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
